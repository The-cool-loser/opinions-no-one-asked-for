    <h1>5 things Disney's Snow White Live Action movie IMPROVED (Spoilers)</h1>

    <p class="description">The Snow White poster</p>
    <p>If you went online in the last year or so, you're probably aware of the infamous live-action remake of Snow White. Everyone seems to hate it with a pure passion, its trailer has so many negative comments that there are FOUR songs made from compilation of these comments, all by the same YouTuber. So, I sat down and watched it, and I was surprised to see - it's actually very good. So to explain why it's better than people gave it credit for, here are 5 things this movie did better than the original</p>
    <h2>#1: Expanding the exposition</h2>
    <p>The original story of Snow White start incredibly simple, with an "evil" queen who took over a kingdom, and asked a mirror if she was the fairest of them all, only to be told her step-daughter, Snow White is. But in this version, despite the story being roughly the same, there's more interest. The evil Queen's selfishness has caused her to ruin a once beautiful Kingdom, and exploring that angle adds a lot of interest to that story</p>
    <h2>#2: A true loves kiss?</h2>
    <p>If you think about it, the true love kiss in the original is quite creepy, because it was given to her by a prince who didn't even know her and only interacted with her while she was comatose because of the apple. In this version, there's serious dedication to the romance between Snow White and the guy who kissed her (who wasn't even a prince), with each of them sacrificing their lives for each other. So when he kisses her, it's more believable</p>
    <h2>#3: Heroine VS Victim</h2>
    <p>In the animated version, Snow White's whole role is to be beautiful, hide from danger, and be saved by a prince. In the live action version, she actively fight against the evil Queen, and risks her life on the way, instead of cowering away. That choice of making her a heroine, who fights alongside people to save herself and others, instead of a victim, who hides from people who want to kill her, feels like a very good move, which makes it easier to cheer for her</p>
    <h2>#4: Exploration of morality</h2>
    <p>The film explores a lot of moral themes which weren't present in the original, themes that match the 2020s a lot better. Between the Evil Queen's statement of "the people don't want a flower (which is fragile and gets ruined easily), they want a diamond (which is tough and lasts forever)" to the song about how in a harsh enviroment sometimes it's better to be cruel and live than to be kind and risk dying</p>
    <h2>#5: It's a full-out musical</h2>
    <p>While there were songs in the original movie, they were few and sparse, this movie has a lot of very catchy melodies, both those in the original movie and new ones, that all sound incredibly nice on the ears.</p>
    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
    <p>While it's still no match to the original, which pretty much invented a whole movie genre, it's a very good remake, that did a lot of good and unique stuff, while staying true to the ideas behind the source mat</p>
