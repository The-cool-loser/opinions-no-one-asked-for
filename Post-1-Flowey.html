    <h2>Who is Flowey?</h2>
<p>If you've ever played the game Undertale, you know exactly who Flowey is. <br> This yellow flower appears at the start of the game and tricks you to make you run into bullets so that he can kill you, and says that in this world "It's kill or be killed",<br>he can easily be described as the main villain in Undertale.<br> However, as some might already know by now, Flowey is actually quite a tragic figure, and by the time you finish this article, you might agree on this</p>



<h2>Where did he come from?</h2>
<p>Flowey's backstory isn't as simple as you might assume.<br>Flowey actually began as the Prince of the Underground, the son of the beloved King Asgore.<br>After saving a human that fell into the Underground, he convinced his father to adopt them as his sibling.<br>But they decided to poison themselves so that Asriel could go into the surface, where he was shot.<br>Then, as a result of a scientific experiment done by Dr Alphys, his essence got injected into a flower</p>



<h2>So why is this tragic?</h2>
<p>Flowey started off as a prince, AKA a future king, one of the most powerful monsters in the Underground,<br>But after dying a painful death, he turned into a being nobody recognizes,<br>And suddenly, this guy who was destined for greatness has become an anonymous loser.<br>He lost everything he had because someone has murdered him for no real reason other than their personal bias.</p>



<h2>Kill or be killed?</h2>

<p>But still, it's hard thinking of Flowey as a victim because he is the game' villain, with an immoral kill or be killed mentality.<br>However, he didn't develop that mentality on his own.<br>The way he was treated when coming onto the surface, being killed due to an irrational fear, plays a great part in the reason behind this thought process</p>



<h2>Final point</h2>

<p>While Flowey is very hurtful throughout most of the game, it is important to recognize that he isn't a 1-dimensional villain who hurt people for no reason,<br>he, like everyone else in Undertale, is a very complex character, whose actions stem from a complex history,<br> And nobody can truly say what they'd do in that situation. And that's what makes that game awesome.</p>
